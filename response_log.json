It was really great to talk to you, I realized that I initially introduced a graph-based approach for the recommendation system, which I believe is a strong fit for modeling social relationships. Later, I also mentioned using tries for certain features, such as handling user data like interests, locations, and organizations. While tries can be useful for some specific tasks, I now recognize that a graph-based structure is a more natural and optimal solution for the core recommendation logic. \n\nI\u2019m really excited about the opportunity to contribute to Ease AI. I\u2019m confident that my experience in machine learning, deep learning, and MLOps pipelines would allow me to make a meaningful impact on your team\u2019s work.\n\nAdditionally, I wanted to mention that I am currently on F1 OPT and would require E-Verify for employment for F1 STEM OPT. Please let me know if you need any further information on this and for your reference here is the resource (https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/work/understanding-e-verify)\n\nThank you again for your time, and I look forward to the next steps.\n\nBest regards,\nSwagath Babu\n\n\nOn Wed, Apr 2, 2025 at 4:14\u202fPM SWAGATH BABU <swagathb18@g.ucla.edu> wrote:\nHi ,  \nThanks for the update!
